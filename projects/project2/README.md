Project 2 - The Pursuit of Happiness

The Concept
Inspired by James Bridle’s essay Something is wrong on the internet, my project criticizes and emphasizes the use of bots in sorting and filtering online content. Although they seemingly simplify our browsing experience, these algorithms help to propagate fake news and censor subject matter. My project demonstrates this idea in an exaggerated manner.

Alice
The user is presented with a virtual assistant named Alice, who interacts with them based on voice commands and how they manipulate the interface. She is supposed to seem friendly and approachable so that the user is encouraged to interact with her. To make the experience feel more personal, she introduces herself and asks for the user to do the same. My goal was to make her feel less robotic (though she certainly sounds robotic) and more dynamic at first. By generating her speech from arrays, she initially seems more interactive and present. The user can request her assistance by clicking any of the microphone icons, and she will also give her input whenever clicks a link or a button. However as she begins to get very repetitive, imposing, and restrictive, it becomes increasingly frustrating for the user.

Although Alice’s speech generates from arrays and is not truly dynamic or responsive to the user, she is supposed to represent an artificially intelligent bot. With the Internet being filled with fake news, conspiracy theories, and other irrational information, Alice’s comments reflect this content as if she learns from it.

The Newsfeed
After Alice has been introduced, the user is asked to select a topic. Once it has been selected, Alice generates a newsfeed mainly composed of fake news and conspiracy theory information.

The newsfeed includes four sections: Recommend Articles, Social Feed, You May Be Interested In, and Ask for Alice’s Opinion. Under Recommended Articles, Alice restricts all educational (intelligent) articles and only permits access to fake news and conspiracy theories. The same goes for the Social Feed section, where Alice does not allow the user to like or repost any intelligent or rational posts. Since online advertisements are typically chosen based on the data collected from previous searches, the You May Be Interested In section shows ad images for items related to the rest of the content being displayed on the page. The final section allows the user to ask Alice for her general opinion on the topic at hand. Like the content she promotes, her opinion is completely irrational.
Aesthetic Intentions
I wanted to make sure the user would interact with the interface before realizing that it is riddled with fake news and conspiracy theories. So, the interface is intended to look clean and approachable to establish initial that initial trust and to encourage the user to explore. If it were disorganized and uninviting, the user may immediately be skeptical of the content displayed.

Final Notes
Crawling all over the Internet, bots make up a significant portion of web traffic. Although Alice is clearly an exaggerated example, bots are generally much more subtle, making it more difficult for the user to distinguish the truth from the fake information that propagates online.
