Project 1 - The Pursuit of Happiness

The Myth of Sisyphus
Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus explores the connection between happiness and the
absurd. Sisyphus is a symbol for mankind, and his chore represents the meaningless of our
everyday lives. Faced with the horrible punishment of performing a task destined for failure, 
Sisyphus' life seems hopeless and tragic. Only when he manages to push the boulder to the
top of the hill will he experience momentary happiness, which raises the following 
question: Is short term happiness true happiness? My interface responds to that question.

The Pursuit of Happiness
Inspired by the myth of Sisyphus, my project is about momentary happiness versus true happiness. 
The aim is to make the character (a face) happy, and the user is presented with a series of
tools that will seemingly help achieve this goal. However, regardless of the user's actions,
the character will never be happy. Like Sisyphus, the user is faced with an impossible
task since the only outcome is short-term happiness which will never result in true
happiness for the character. Even if the user chooses to give up (by clicking the 'Give Up?'
button on the interface), they are asked to continue until their (impossible) goal is 
achieved.

The Interface
The first thing the user is introduced with is a dialog box stating their goal and how
to go about achieving it. They are prompted to close it to begin.

The left-hand side of the interface presents 6 icons: a heart symbolizing love, a brain
for knowledge, a medal for achievements, a dollar bill for wealth, a smiling face for 
humour, and a beer mug for alcohol. Each icon is draggable and is meant to be dropped
onto the character to 'feed it' to him. When dropped onto his face, the icon shrinks
as if being absorbed. If dropped elsewhere, it will revert back to its original position.
Icons are cloned once dragged, so the categories don't run out and the user can keep 
dragging/dropping an infinite number of times.

Once the user believes to have made the character happy, they may ask him by clicking
the button in the bottom right corner. This will display a random response from an array.
Any given response will be negative thus prompting the user to continue the hopeless task
of dragging and dropping the icons. The user is also given a button to “give up”, however
clicking it always leads to the same outcome - a dialog box that tells them they have not
yet succeeded in their task and must keep trying. 

The character’s skin animates (fades) between two shades of blue to create a glowing effect.
His facial expression alternates between 3 images. By default, he is sad and looking
towards the group of icons to entice the user to drag them over. Once an icon is dropped 
onto the face, this triggers a different image where he looks a little less sad (momentary 
happiness?). This is accompanied with a ‘Huh?’ sound because the character is intrigued with 
the concept of being temporarily happy. Once the user hovers back to the icons, the face 
goes back to its default image. If the user clicks the button to ask him if he’s happy, he 
starts to tear up as if in his most sad state. This is because he acknowledges how sad he 
truly is and how hopeless his life feels. It also triggers a random sound effect from the 
array of crying sounds.
